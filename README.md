# Design System with Storybook

[Storybook Preview](https://storybook-components-red.vercel.app/)

A modern, responsive design system built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Storybook, featuring pixel-perfect components and comprehensive testing.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: Latest App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling with design system tokens
- **Storybook**: For component documentation and visual testing
- **Vitest**: For unit testing with React Testing Library
- **Radix UI/shadcn/ui**: For accessible primitive components

### Design System Architecture

- Atomic design principles with composable components
- Consistent type definitions and interfaces
- Shared utilities
- Standardized naming conventions and file structure

## Development Process

### Component Development Workflow

1. Define component requirements and API
2. Create component with TypeScript types
3. Implement Storybook stories for all variants
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
5. Document usage and props
6. Review and refine accessibility

### Pixel Perfect Implementation

- Used design tokens for consistent spacing, typography, and colors
- Implemented responsive breakpoints with Tailwind
- Created reusable utility classes for common patterns
- Maintained consistent component APIs

### Quality Assurance

- ESLint and TypeScript for code quality
- Vitest for unit testing
- Storybook for visual regression testing
- Responsive design testing across devices

## AI-Assisted Development

### How AI Enhanced the Development Process

   - Quick implementation of repetitive patterns

2. **Code Quality**

   - AI suggestions for type improvements
   - Identification of potential edge cases

3. **Documentation**

   - Automated generation of component documentation
   - Story creation for Storybook

4. **Problem Solving**
   - Quick debugging assistance
   - Pattern recognition for common issues
   - Alternative implementation suggestions
